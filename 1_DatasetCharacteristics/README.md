# Dataset Characteristics
To explore the dataset we created two notebook:
- Ba_exploring
- Umsatzdaten-scatterplats. 
In these notebooks we explored the following questions:

- How does the revenue change over the months
    - July and August (summer) are the months with the highest revenue
- How does the revenue change over the course of a week?
    - Saturday and Sunday are the days with the highest revenue. Sunday higher than Saturday.
- How much does each product grup contribute to the total revenue. Is there a pattern?
- Which days have a significant high revenue?
    - New Years Eve
